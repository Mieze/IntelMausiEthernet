OS X driver for Intel onboard LAN

A few days before Christmas I started my latest project, a new driver for recent Intel onboard LAN controllers. My intention was not to replace hnak's AppleIntelE1000e.kext completely but to deliver best performance and stability on recent hardware. That's why I dropped support for a number of older NICs. Currently the driver supports:
 
- 5 Series
  - 82578LM
  - 82578LC
  - 82578DM
  - 82578DC
- 6 and 7 Series
  - 82579LM
  - 82579V
- 8 and 9 Series
  - I217LM
  - I217V
  - I218LM
  - I218V
  - I218LM2
  - I218V2
  - I218LM3
- 100 Series
  - I219V
  - I219LM
  - I219V2
  - I219LM2
  - I219LM3

Key Features of the Driver
- Support for multisegment packets relieving the network stack of unnecessary copy operations when assembling packets for transmission.
- No-copy receive and transmit. Only small packets are copied on reception because creating a copy is more efficient than allocating a new buffer.
- TCP, UDP and IPv4 checksum offload (receive and transmit).
- Support for TCP/IPv6 and UDP/IPv6 checksum offload.
- Makes use of the chip's TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO) feature with IPv4 and IPv6 in order to reduce CPU load while sending large amounts of data.
- Fully optimized for Yosemite and Mavericks (64bit architecture) but should work with Mountain Lion and Lion too, provided you build from source with the 10.8 or 10.7 SDK.
- Support for Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE).
- VLAN support is implemented but untested as I have no need for it.
- The driver is published under GPLv2.
